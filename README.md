# NewELearnLMS
e-learning LMS Application

This project involves developing an eLearning platform designed to create a robust, scalable, and customizable online learning environment. It will support educational institutions, corporations, and individual educators in delivering courses and training programs efficiently. The platform will include modules for course creation, user management, assessments, communication, and reporting.

The system will feature a comprehensive admin module to manage courses, users, and content effectively. It will allow instructors to create detailed courses, manage student enrollments, and track progress. Students will be able to enroll in courses, access learning materials, and participate in assessments.

The project will encompass the development of course management, user management, assessment tools, communication tools, and reporting functionalities. This holistic approach aims to enhance the learning experience and administrative efficiency, providing a seamless and secure eLearning environment.

To ensure security and integrity, the platform will use strict access controls so only authorized users can manage courses and sensitive data. It will verify user identities with strong authentication and protect data with encryption. Additionally, traceability and audit features will maintain the authenticity and integrity of user interactions and data.
